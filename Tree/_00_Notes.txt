Tree :
-------
    hierarchical data structor.

Types Of Tree:

    1. Full Binary Tree. 
        -> every node can have either 0 or 2 children.
    2. Complete Binary Tree 
        -> all levels are Completely filled except the last level.
        -> the last level has all nodes on left as possible .

    3. Perfect Binary Tree.
        -> all leaf nodes are at same level.
    4. Balance Binary Tree.
        -> height of tree at max log(N). N is no of nodes.
    5. Degenerate Tree.
        -> every node has a single children 


Binary Trre Representation :


    class Node {
        int data;
        Node left;
        Node right;
        Node(int data) {
            this.data = data
            left = null;
            right = null;
        }
    }


Binary Tree Traversals Techniques (BFS / DFS):

DFS - Depth First Search :
    1. InOrder Traversal (left, root, right)
    2. PreOrder Traversal (root, left, right)
    3. PostOrder Traversal (left, right, root)

BFS - Birth First Search : 
    1. Level Order Traversal
